Rhyme-Time Technical Assessment

What are you looking at?
The codebase for a full-stack application that helps users find rhyming words.

What is this about?
Wouldn’t it be nice if we could simply build all applications from scratch, in our own style? Unfortunately, we can’t always do that, especially when working on something that is already in production or being used by customers. Most code we encounter as developers is not old, spaghetti, or broken because the previous team was lazy, but because it was the only way to deliver something within the constraints of limited time and resources. Often, especially in startups, the wheels of business are always spinning, and there’s only so much time to get something out the door for customers to see.

For this reason, I don’t want you to code something from scratch. Instead, I want you to face something that already exists.

I designed this tiny application for your interview to be flawed by design. While looking at the code, you may find issues of different types. Some issues are critical and will break the app’s functionality, some are efficiency-related, and others are security vulnerabilities.

The technical interview will be based on this codebase. I want you to walk me through the issues you found in a structured way and provide suggestions for alternative, better implementations. It is not a strict requirement to fix all issues before or during the interview, but I want to see if you can identify, understand and COOMUNICATE some of the these flaws, that are also commonly found in other problematic codebases.

The technical interview will focus on a code review of the original code in this repository.
I want you to prepare a walkthrough of the code and the issues you identified, along with your suggestions for addressing them.
Please refrain from reading directly from a script during the interview, as this will not help your application. Instead, imagine you are explaining the issues to someone outside of development that is very interested in the topic.
Make sure to communicate the issues you found and your proposed solutions in a clear and structured manner. You are free to choose the format in which you present them.

Getting Started

Here are some hints for getting started:
	1.	Get the app running on your local machine.
	2.	Analyze the code and identify potential issues in the following categories:
	•	Functionality
	•	Security
	•	Efficiency
	•	(Can you think of other categories?) wink
	3.	Document the identified issues and notes in detail to prepare for your walkthrough during the interview.

Additional Notes
	•	During the interview, you may or may not be asked to perform live coding or answer questions unrelated to the provided codebase.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.12+
	•	pip
	•	A modern web browser
	•	requirements.txt
	•	The app is served via main.py
