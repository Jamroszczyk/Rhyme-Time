# **Rhyme-Time Technical Assessment**

## **What are you looking at?**
The codebase for a full-stack application that helps users find rhyming words.

---

## **What is this about?**
Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if we could simply build all applications from scratch, in our own style?  
Unfortunately, we canâ€™t always do that, especially when working on something that is already in production or being used by customers.  

Most code we encounter as developers is not old, spaghetti, or broken because the previous team was lazy, but because it was the only way to deliver something within the constraints of limited time and resources. Often, especially in startups, the wheels of business are always spinning, and thereâ€™s only so much time to get something out the door for customers to see.  

For this reason, **I donâ€™t want you to code something from scratch. Instead, I want you to face something that already exists.**

I designed this tiny application for your interview to be **flawed by design**. While looking at the code, you may find issues of different types:  
- Some issues are **critical** and will break the appâ€™s functionality.  
- Some are **efficiency-related**.  
- Others are **security vulnerabilities**.  

The **technical interview** will be based on this codebase. I want you to walk me through the issues you found in a **structured way** and provide suggestions for **alternative, better implementations**.  
It is not a strict requirement to fix **all** the issues before or during the interview, but I want to see if you can **identify, understand, and communicate** some of the most impactfull flaws, which are commonly found in problematic codebases and explain the code you see to me.

The interview will focus on your **code review** of the original code in this repository.  
I want you to:
- Prepare a structured walkthrough of the original code and the issues you identified.
- Suggest solutions to address these issues. If it suits the issue, you may show alternative code.

### **Tips for presenting your findings:**
- **Avoid reading directly from a script. It will not help your application.** Instead, imagine explaining the issues to someone outside of development who is curious about the topic.  
- Focus on communicating your findings and proposed solutions in a **clear and structured** manner.
- You are free to choose the format for your presentation and how you show me that you know what you are doing.

## **Getting Started**

Here are some hints to help you get started:

1. Get the app running on your local machine.
2. Analyze the code and identify potential issues in the following categories:
   - **Functionality**  
   - **Security**  
   - **Efficiency**  
   - *(Can you think of other categories?)* ðŸ˜‰  
3. Document the identified issues and your notes in detail to prepare for your walkthrough during the interview.

Hint: Don't ask me for the password ;)

## **Additional Notes**
- During the interview, you may or may not be asked to perform live coding or answer questions unrelated to the provided codebase.
